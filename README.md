## Q1 Project : Real-Time Temp/Barometer/Altitude Station
***
_Base functionality:_  
Pull sensor readings from AVR, push to remote mySQL dB.  
Contrast actual measurements against readings collected from the Underground Weather API.  
Display raw sensor readings against API values.  
Display users (browser) location based on Google Geolocation.  

_Hardware Used:_  
Arduino Mega 2560  
MPL3115A2 Sensor: Temperatur, Barometer, Altitude telemetry.  

_API's Used:_  
Underground Weather API  
Google Maps API  


_Someday:_  
If possible:  
Suggest daily activities based on weather.   
Display historical values for current date (as/if available).
